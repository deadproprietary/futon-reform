hi. i'm **pillow**.  
i'm a **{calcAge(972126000000)}**-year-old <span title="swedish" style="text-decoration: underline dotted darkgrey 1px;">ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</span> digital illustrator on the internet.  
i use **any** pronouns. 

thanks for stopping by.

i mostly specialize in **character illustration/pin-ups** as well as dabbling in **comics**, but i enjoy learning new things about visual art.

i've been drawing since 2018, and i started to take it *seriously* around 2020.

i'm self-taught, using mostly guides from Twitter, YouTube and other places on the Internet, as well as getting mutual feedback from my friends and peers.

my goal at the moment is to create my own comic.  
i don't care if it'll be good or not, as long as i make it.

i use Clip Studio Paint and/or Krita as my main software.  
i use an XP-Pen Artist 24 Pro screen tablet.

this site is a constant work in progress, and is [openly available on Github.](https://github.com/deadproprietary/futon-reform)

in the future i hope to use this site as a portfolio and potentially to host comics, as well as my characters and stories.
